# RTL Design, Synthesis and Optimization using Yosys and SKY130 PDKs 

In VLSI industry Front-end digital design inlcudes RTL design, synthesis, optimization and verification. In the current repository i have included the deisgn, synthesis and optimization work on various digital modules, from very simple digital logic (mux, decoder, encoder etc.) to complex designs(barrel shifter, booth multiplier, simple dual port ram etc). All the work have been done using open source tools:-
 * iverilog for RTL simulation.
 * gtkwave for reading vcd file and waveform generation.
 * yosys for synthesis and netlist generation.
 * skywater 130nm open source pdk.

## Introduction of OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE

With the introduction of open-source tools in the ASIC flow now VLSI engineers have opportunity to design and craft their ideas starting from RTL 2 GDSII.  
In this repository i have included RTL codes from very simple digital modules
